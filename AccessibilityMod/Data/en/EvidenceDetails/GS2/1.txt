A uniformed officer lies face-down on the ground at night, positioned between a public phone booth and a discarded police cap.

The victim lies prone in the center of the frame on a paved surface. He wears a short-sleeved uniform shirt with a dark tie and trousers. His left arm extends straight out to the side, while his right arm is bent, positioning his hand near his face. His right index finger presses against the ground, pointing directly at a set of scrawled markings on the pavement beneath him. To the left of the body, a peaked police cap rests upside down in the foreground.

To the right stands a glass-paneled phone booth backed by a high retaining wall constructed of large, irregular stone blocks. A bright light fixture mounted on the wall above the booth illuminates the area, casting strong highlights on the victim and the booth. On the left side of the scene, a tall pole with a circular face, resembling a clock, stands vertically near the edge of a park bench that is partially visible on the far left border.

At the top of the image, a metal railing runs along the upper edge of the stone wall. Four distinct figures lean over the railing, looking down at the scene. The sky above is dark, indicating night, with visible stars and tree branches overhanging from the upper left corner.
