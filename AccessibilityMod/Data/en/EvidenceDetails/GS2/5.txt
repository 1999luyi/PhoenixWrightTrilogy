A light purple, kimono-style jacket floats against a black background, bearing significant bloodstains and a single puncture hole.

The garment is an open-front top with wide sleeves, revealing a darker purple interior lining. Deep red stains resembling blood soil the fabric prominently. A large, concentrated smear covers the left chest and lapel area, while a separate, intense stain marks the upper right lapel. Smaller red droplets and trails scatter down the lower left front panel.

On the right sleeve, positioned slightly below the shoulder, a small, dark, circular hole penetrates the fabric. The garment is presented in isolation, illuminated to highlight the stains and the tear.
