A low-angle, tilted close-up shows a woman holding a revolver, her ceremonial clothing splattered with dark stains.

The woman dominates the foreground, looking down with a blank, wide-eyed expression. She wears a traditional robe and a necklace of large beads featuring a central, comma-shaped magatama. Heavy, dark liquid stains splatter the front of her chest and the fabric of her inner garment. She holds a revolver in her right hand, positioned loosely to her side, while her left arm is raised near her head.

In the background to the right, a man in a suit lies prone on a tatami mat platform, mirroring the victim seen in the wider crime scene photo. To the left, blurred shelves filled with lit candles recede into the distance.
