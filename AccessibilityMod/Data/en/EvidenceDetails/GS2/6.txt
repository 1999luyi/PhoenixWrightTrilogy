A black-and-white photograph depicts a woman holding a revolver, standing over a motionless body in a room filled with candles.

In the left foreground, a woman with long, straight dark hair and a topknot stands with her back to the viewer. She wears a robe adorned with a large spherical ornament and a tassel on the back. Her right hand is raised to shoulder height, gripping a revolver.

In the center of the room, a man wearing a dark suit lies face-down on a raised platform composed of two tatami mats. His arms are splayed outward, and a dark stain spreads on the mat around his upper torso and head.

The room is enclosed by shelves along the left and right walls, which are densely packed with lit candles, creating numerous bright flares of light. Larger, freestanding candle holders line the floor on the right. At the far end of the room, a low wooden altar supports a circular mirror, positioned in front of a folding screen.
