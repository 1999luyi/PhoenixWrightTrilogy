A close-up, overhead view depicts a man lying on the ground, using his finger to write the name "Maggie" in the dirt.

The man lies on his stomach in the lower center of the frame. He has short, dark hair and wears a white, short-sleeved uniform shirt. His head is turned to the right in profile, revealing a tense expression with wide, staring eyes.

His right arm extends upward across the composition. With his index finger, he traces the end of the name "Maggie" into the loose surface. The finger remains pressed against the ground at the tail of the final letter "e."

The name is written in large, somewhat shaky cursive script, occupying the upper left and center of the image. The ground is a flat, grey surface textured with grit and scattered with small, round pebbles. Shadows fall to the left of the man's head and arm, indicating a light source coming from the upper right.
