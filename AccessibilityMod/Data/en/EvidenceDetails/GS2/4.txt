A schematic diagram illustrates the floor plan of a rectangular room, featuring a central square area and fixtures along the right wall.

The room is oriented horizontally with a beige background and thick brown outlines. A dark brown rectangular strip is centered on the left wall, representing a doorway. In the middle of the room, a large square is divided into four smaller, equal squares.

Four small circles are placed symmetrically around this central square area: one near the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right corners of the central formation.

Along the right side of the room, a vertical column of three small shapes stands between the central square and the wall. A rectangle containing a vertical oval is sandwiched between two small squares. A sharp zigzag line extends vertically along the inner edge of the right wall.
