A color photograph captures three individuals standing in a row against a light purple background, with a golden suit of armor partially visible on the far right.

On the left stands a tall, broad-shouldered older man with spiky grey hair and a styled white goatee. He wears purple-tinted sunglasses and a bright orange double-breasted suit with gold buttons, worn over a black shirt. A red ascot is fastened at his neck with a gold ring. He smiles broadly with his black-gloved hands clasped in front of him.

In the center stands a man wearing a brown cowboy hat with a gold band and a matching brown vest with fringe over a white shirt and pink tie. He holds a trophy consisting of a green, shield-shaped backing and a large, jagged yellow letter "K".

To his right stands a young woman with long, straight brown hair. She wears a dark brown military-style uniform jacket adorned with gold epaulettes and buttons, along with a red scarf. Her expression is solemn, and her hands are folded before her. Behind her, a large, dark urn rests on a ledge. To the far right, the golden torso and arm of a suit of armor are visible, draped with a red cloth and holding a silver lance.
