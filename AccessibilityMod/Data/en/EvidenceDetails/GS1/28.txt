A crude, black-and-white drawing executed in thick, messy strokes appears on a white background bisected by a vertical fold line.

The image is divided into two distinct halves. On the right side, a large, dark silhouette floats in the center. The shape resembles a jester’s hat or a three-pronged crown; it has three curved points extending upward and outward, each tipped with a small circle or sphere. The interior of the shape is heavily scribbled in black.

On the left side, a stick-figure drawing depicts a person oriented horizontally. The figure's feet are planted against a thick, dark vertical strip that runs along the far left edge of the paper. The body extends outward to the right, leaning forward as if suspended from or pushing off the vertical strip. The figure appears to hold a small, rectangular object in a raised hand near its head. Below this main figure, a second, smaller set of scribbled lines suggests another figure or object on the ground. Dark, jagged patches frame the top and bottom right corners of the page.
