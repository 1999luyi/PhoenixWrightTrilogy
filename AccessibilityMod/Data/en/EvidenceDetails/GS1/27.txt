A black-and-white photograph depicts a man slumped lifelessly against the front of a suit of plate armor.

The man stands in the foreground, his body leaning forward with his head bowed and eyes closed. He wears a light-colored dress shirt, a tie, and a vest featuring fringe details across the chest. A dark liquid trickles from the corner of his mouth, and a large, spreading dark stain saturates the center of his chest, soaking through his tie and vest.

Immediately behind the victim stands a full suit of medieval-style plate armor. The armor faces forward with its helmet visor down. The victim's position obscures the armor's lower torso and legs, but the chest plate, helmet, and left arm are clearly visible. The background features a wall with a rectangular grid pattern, possibly paneling or a screen.
